Since then, a number of institutions across the globe have hosted the competition including recently, the Universities of Reading, Exeter and Ulster. From 2014, the contest has been run under the aegis of the AISB, the world’s first AI society (founded 1964) at Bletchley Park where Alan Turing worked as a code-breaker during World War 2."+

    "The Contest"+

    "\n\nThe contest consists of 4 rounds where in each round, the 4 judges will each interact with two entities using a computer terminal. One of these entities will be a human ‘confederate’ and the other an AI system. After 25 minutes of questioning the judge must decide which entity is the human and which is the AI. If a system can fool half the judges that it is human under these conditions, a solid Silver Medal will be awarded to the creator of that AI system. In the event that this doesn’t happen, prizes will be awarded to the creators of the AI system as follows in accordance with judges’ ranked scores:"+

    "\n\n1st place – a bronze medal and $4000"+
    "\n2nd place – $1500"+
    "\n3rd place – $1000"+
    "\n4th place – $500"+

    "\n\nSelection Process"+

    "\n\nThe top four entries from the pool of entries that conform to the entry specifications will be selected as follows. Each entry will be provided with a set of 20 questions in English in a similar format to previous competitions, with at least 2 Winograd style questions. The responses from each of the AI systems will be recorded for this question set and then assessed for how human their responses are. The top 4 entries from this process will be entered into the finals of the competition at Bletchley Park."+

If a system can fool half the judges that it is human under these conditions, a solid Silver Medal will be awarded to the creator of that AI system.

Our aim is for this event to bring together researchers in computing, the arts, sciences, and other fields of cultural endeavor. To mark the historic nature of this occasion we plan to meet in the Waldegrave Drawing Room at St Mary’s University, adjacent to Strawberry Hill House, the gothic castle in Twickenham built by Horace Walpole, who invented the concept of ‘serendipity’ in 1754.

    "This workshop, Agent-Based Models of Bounded Rationality was held 7-8 May 2015 in Slagelse, University of Southern Denmark, and it was organized by Davide Secchi and Stephen J. Cowley. The purpose of this workshop was that of exploring how agent-based models (ABM) can either build on existing knowledge on bounded rationality (BR), find alternative/complementary con- ceptualizations, or move away from the original concept. More information on this workshop, including some of the slides are available on the workshop’s website (https://sites.google.com/site/abmworkshops/)"

    "This two-day workshop held at The University of Birmingham on 18-19 August 2014, aimed to provide a venue for researchers to communicate recent results from their efforts to model how forms of figurative language such as metaphor and metonymy are used to communicate domain-specific information (e.g. in political discourse, presenting an argument can be described as “attacking an opponent’s position”, or in health discourse, infection can be described in terms of microbes “attacking someone’s body”). The workshop was jointly organized through the University’s Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) as well as the AISB, with the IAS generously sponsoring a number of invited talks by key researchers in the field. The 15 talks across 4 sessions were complemented with open discussion slots spread throughout both days. Participants came from various countries, including the U.K., Italy, Ireland, Germany, Spain and the U.S.A, and from disciplines as diverse as artificial intelligence, linguistics, architecture, psychology, literary studies, computer science and philosophy."

The event sought to examine the applications, structure, how-to, potentials, and philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of agent-based models (ABMs) as they apply to organisational behaviour and social agency. We had one day and a half of paper sessions, with social and networking activities. Participants came from seven countries, including the UK, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Canada, and Italy.

    "Since 1964, the AISB has had an aim to foster the engagement of interdisciplinary subjects in the field of AI. Over the years the range of topics have grown substantially, but the question of consciousness has remained at the forefront of such interests. To that end, the 3rd AISB Workshop  on The Emergence Of Consciousness took place at St Mary’s University in Strawberry Hill, London on 9 May 2013. The basis for the workshop was to consider what is meant by the idea of consciousness, and to explore the idea of how, when, and why it emerged and emerges. A selection of papers from that conference has now been published in a Symposium Issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies, which is available via this link."

(The article should ideally be written using LaTeX.). This article should be sent by email rather than hardcopy. In certain cases, the conference report can be substituted with a report on the student’s research. The report should be approximately 700-1000 words.  It can be longer (up to, say, 1500 words) but should not be much if any shorter."+

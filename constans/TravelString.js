    "The AISB makes student travel grants available to its members. The awards are typically for a couple of hundred pounds and it is our preference to fund conference travel where a student is giving a presentation of some description. These awards are available to all students (i.e., undergraduate and postgraduate masters students as well as those studying for a PhD). We expect the topic of the conference to be relevant to Artificial Intelligence or Cognitive Science although obviously more general Computer Science conferences are also acceptable if the presented work is relevant to the society’s areas of interest."

    "\n\u25cf Student travel awards are usually limited to £400 maximum."+
    "\n\n\u25cf AISB generally sponsors only one student travel grant to any given Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence/Cognitive Science conference."+
    "\n\n\u25cf On request, we send out a student travel award letter that can be used as collateral for an institutional `loan’ (e.g., university buying you the ticket)."+
    "\n\n\u25cf The recipient must write a short article about their work suitable for publication in AISBQ within 3 months of the event, and send it to the Treasurer. (The article should ideally be written using LaTeX.). This article should be sent by email rather than hardcopy. In certain cases, the conference report can be substituted with a report on the student’s research. The report should be approximately 700-1000 words.  It can be longer (up to, say, 1500 words) but should not be much if any shorter."+
    "\n\n\u25cf Once the conference report has been accepted by the AISBQ editor, the AISB treasurer transfers the award to a UK bank account or or via Paypal for the value of the student travel award."+
    "\n\n\u25cf The AISB greatly prefers to grant student travel awards to people who are giving a paper or publicly talking, rather than just attending a conference. We also prefer to grant student travel awards for travel to relevant conferences (i.e., those in the fields of Artificial Intelligence or Cognitive Science) or for presentations at more general Computer Science conferences where the subject of the presentation is relevant to Artificial Intelligence or Cognitive Science."+
    "\n\n\u25cf AISB does not offer travel awards for any AISB convention symposia or other AISB-organised events under its Travel Award scheme. However, at the discretion of the event organiser, there may be some student bursaries available. Please contact the event organiser for details."

If it is not immediately obvious that the conference is relevant to Artificial Intelligence or Cognitive Science we would appreciate some details of the conference. Any conference or workshop listed in one of our Weekly Bulletin is almost certainly relevant."+
    "\n\n\u25cf Whether presenting a paper and if so, some more info such as a title and abstract.
